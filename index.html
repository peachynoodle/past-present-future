<h2>Past</h2>

<img class="left" src="images/toddler.jpg" alt="Me Sitting in a Stroller">

<p>I was born in <a href="http://www.greenvillesc.gov/">Greenville, SC</a> and I've lived here for my entire life. My childhood was filled with going outside to play with my friends and riding bikes, playing pretend, drawing on the walls (which I got in trouble for), and watching cartoon shows that don't air anymore. From then on, elementary and middle school went by terribly fast. I went to Mauldin Elementary and I barely remember anything, but I remember much more from my experience at Beck Academy. I've moved around twice: once when I was very young and another time about two years ago. Below are some highlights from my past:</p>

<h2>Present</h2>

<p>My immediate family consists of myself, my older brother (who is 21 currently), and my mom and dad. I don't get to see my brother as often since he's attending Clemson University. I do get to see my parents a little more, and they both are very hard-working. An example is how we renovated our house together before we moved in. It was a lot of work and my dad did a bulk of it. Our house looks so much better, inside and outside, compared to when we first bought it. I'm glad that it was something we all contributed to. Our family has a great dynamic and we all care and love about each other.</p>

<p>My current interests include drawing, listening to music, dancing, talking to friends, and taking long naps. I have always liked doing a majority of these things, but some have become bigger parts in my daily life. I focus a lot on drawing and art in general, since I want to make this hobby into a career. Overall, my life is actually quite boring when I think about it. Everything is a cycle: go to school, go to the <a href="http://www.fineartscenter.net/">Fine Arts Center</a>, go home, take a nap, draw, eat, do my homework, then rinse and repeat.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<img class="left" src="images/sva.png" alt="School of the Visual Arts Logo">

<p>My plans after high school are to go to college and get a good job afterwards. I plan to major in either Illustration or Graphic Design (both of which have many jobs available.) I really would like to attend college in New York City. I'm looking at the <a href="http://www.sva.edu/">School of Visual Arts</a> and hope that my portfolio is strong enough for me to get in. I plan on going up to New York City to do a summer program this year and get a feel of the school and its atmosphere. Hopefully, everything will work out well.</p>
